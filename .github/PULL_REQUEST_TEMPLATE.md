Submit your Hackathon project following these steps:

**Part 1:**

1. [Create a new file in `hackathon-submissions` folder](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-hackathon-hackerearth-jan2020/tree/master/hackathon-submissions). Please use `.md` as the extension of the file.
2. Name the file `<your-github-username>-<your-submission-name>`. For example, `jasonblais-build-chatbot`.
3. Include either 
 - a link to a repository containing your project (e.g. an integration or plugin), or
 - a short, 1-2 paragraph description of your work.
4. Submit your changes as a pull request. If other members worked with you on the project, please make sure to include that in your pull request description.

**Part 2:**

5. Submit a link to the pull request (from step 4) on HackerEarth to count as a hackathon participant.
